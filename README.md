# A Website Creator Written in Python

This website creator is a small example in a big picture, the idea is you can connect this website creator to
different python modules. Do you want to make a website scraper? Ez just connect this script to an website api
and make it inside a loop and you got a website scraper/creator.
<p>
In the future there will be more example on how to get this to work.
<p>
<b>Run this script</b><p>
cd websitecreator/ &&
python example.py<p>
<b>Images example</b<p>
